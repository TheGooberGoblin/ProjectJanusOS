🚀 [Release] Janus v1.0 – A Transparent, Prompt-Based Operating System for LLMs
Ever wish you could run an AI system that’s fully visible, doesn’t need the cloud, and works across models like GPT-4o, Claude, Gemini, or DeepSeek?
Janus v1.0 is that system.
It’s a prompt-based virtual machine—built entirely from structured language—that turns your LLM into a replayable, forkable, memory-safe runtime.
There’s no code, no APIs, no plugins. Just well-structured text.
🧱 What Janus Is (In Plain English)
Janus is like a symbolic operating system made out of prompts.
It gives you a way to:
✅ Save memory between sessions (manually)
✅ Branch conversations and merge them later
✅ Track what happened and why—like a flight recorder
✅ Export your session to a .januspack you can re-run later
✅ Run “what-if” simulations without messing up your main work
✅ Build your own offline database, tutor system, or AI logic
Everything runs on structured tokens (like [[memory.card]] and [[trace_id]]) that any modern LLM can understand.
traints (By Design, Not Limitation)
Janus follows a strict set of constraints designed to enforce transparency, reproducibility, and control. These rules aren’t workarounds—they’re the point:
🧠 No Executable Code There’s zero scripting, no hidden logic, and no plugin execution. All logic is expressed in plain language using symbolic tokens (e.g., [[memory.card]], [[trace_id]], [[fork → merge]]). It simulates cognition, but doesn’t run anything.
📴 Offline-Only Operation Everything works in fully air-gapped environments. No APIs, no servers, no external dependencies. If you can open a text file and paste into an LLM, you can run Janus.
📂 Manual State Control The user manually controls all memory—hydrating and dehydrating symbolic data via .txt files or copy/paste. Nothing is stored unless you store it. This eliminates hidden state and gives you full visibility over what’s remembered.
🧩 Cross-Model Compatibility Janus was built to run the same across GPT-4o, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, and other capable models. It avoids vendor-specific syntax and token tricks. It uses clean, consistent symbolic grammar to stay portable.
🪞 Full Transparency & Traceability Every decision, fork, badge, and branch is logged. Sessions can be replayed, memory can be diffed, and every “action” includes trace metadata and user-readable reasoning. There is no black box.
🧠 Who This Is For
Janus might be for you if you:
🔹 Like building things with GPT but want more control and structure
🔹 Want your AI projects to work the same across different models
🔹 Care about data privacy or offline access
🔹 Work in education, civic tech, tabletop world-building, or simulation
🔹 Just like cool language-based systems that push the edge of prompt design
It runs entirely in the chat window—nothing to install, nothing to buy.
💡 Use Cases
Here’s where Janus shines:
📚 Education & Tutoring
Build learning flows with quiz modules, badge awards, memory logs, and rehydration from previous sessions.
🏛 Civic or Government Work
Design transparent workflows (like permits, audits, Q&A) that run locally and are 100% readable + auditable.
🔐 Air-Gapped / Secure Environments
Janus works with no network, no code execution, and supports encrypted memory blocks + role-based access.
📦 Offline, Human-Readable Databases
You can literally store structured "AI memory" in text files—easy to search, save, fork, or print.
🧪 Simulation & AI Prototyping
Run symbolic “what-if” paths. Fork a session and explore alternate decisions—then merge results later.
🔍 Why Use Janus Instead of Just… Prompting?
Because it gives you:
🧠 Memory control (with TTLs and history)
🛠️ Forking tools to simulate multiple outcomes
🔁 Rehydration of sessions from plain text logs
🔒 Export safety with hash checks and signatures
🧹 Session cleanup (like rollup summaries and memory pruning)
🧩 Cross-model consistency—no vendor-specific behavior
Janus treats your AI like a virtual machine made out of language.
Everything it “does” is visible. Nothing is hidden. Nothing runs without your say.
📝 Getting Started
Download the PDF or copy-paste the starter bundle from GitHub
Paste it into GPT-4o, Claude, Gemini, or DeepSeek
Follow the walk-through. Everything runs inside the chat.
Fork it. Remix it. Export your own .januspack.
If you're into prompt design, symbolic logic, educational tools, or just like experimenting with new AI workflows—this system is open-ended by design. Would love some minds brighter than mind to tear this part and put it back together for their own use cases. If you have feature requests feel free to suggest it and our team will look into the possibility of implementation within the project constraints. 
It’s not meant to be perfect. It’s meant to be remixed.
🧠 Feedback welcome.
🔧 Forks encouraged.

## 👤 User Profiles

Janus OS supports structured symbolic sessions for various roles:

- `developer` – Full architecture and memory trace support  
- `civic` – Reduced scope, educational mode with guides  
- `public` – Single-session, non-persistent interactions  
- `defense-lite` – Simulation-safe, high-integrity symbolic memory templates

Custom `[[profile.card]]` entries can be declared within `.januspack` for new roles.

---

## 🔧 Getting Started

1. Open any Janus-compliant model with `prompt-rehydration` support  
2. Load a `.januspack` file containing `README_JANUS_v1.0.md`  
3. Include a `[[trace_id]]`, `[[memory.card]]`, or `[[plugin.card]]` in your input  
4. Use `@mode ultra` for full features or `@mode lite` for simplified flows  
5. For validation, pipe output through `janus.validator_harness.v2`  

> Note: No code required. Output is symbolic and rerunnable from text only.
